2. Do some research into IMAP and POP3, and create a short list of the biggest
differences between them.

- POP3 downloads the messages from the server and then deletes them, with only one copy remaining on the computer.
- IMAP can sync to the server and check from multiple devices (mail stays on the server)
- Sent mail on POP3 also stays on the PC, not on the mail server, where IMAP sent mail stays on the server.

- So, you have to pull you messages from the server when you want to check for new ones, where IMAP syncs. 

3. Configure a typical GUI e-mail program, such as Thunderbird.
Considering the options you saw when setting up the account, what further
inprovements could be made?
