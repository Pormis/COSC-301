4. Assume you are providing a file mirroring service for many clients
(eg. a public Ubuntu mirror). Assume further that you are providing
mirrors for other distributions. What is the benefit of using the hostname
«http://ubuntu.example.com/» instead of «http://www.example.com/ubuntu/»?
Is there a difference? Why might one be more preferable above the other.
Tip: consider what would need to happen if we wanted to change which server
offered the Ubuntu repository.

Looking up the hostname to find the mapped ip is easier. If you used the ww.example.com/ubuntu/ then you would have to change the server, but if you used the former you could just add a new mapping?
