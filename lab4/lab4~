Q1. Describe multicast, as opposed to unicast and broadcast.
Also, give an example of an IPv6 multicast address.


Q2. Give an example of a link-local IPv6 address. Briefly describe how it is generally
formed from the Ethernet MAC address.


Q3. Give an example of a “unique-local” IPv6 address.


Q4. Describe a Solicited Node [multicast] address. What is its purpose? Give an
example. How is it formed?


Q5. Multicast Listener Discovery version 2 (MLDv2) Snooping is a mandatory feature
for any switch that wants to support IPv66What is the motivation for MLDv2
snooping, which in the IPv4 world we might compare with “IGMP Snooping”? We
want to see that you understand its purpose with respect to network switches (not
routers). You may like to include a diagram with a little table showing real IPv6
multicast addresses (such as two solicited node addresses, and an all-routers
address (ff02::2) and switch port numbers.


Q6. Briefly describe the most important components of a router advertisement.


Q7. Briefly describe Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). Why is it needed and how is it
performed? What do you think the difference is between a “Tentative” address and
a “Preferred” address, with regard to DAD?
