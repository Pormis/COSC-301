1.Identify the particular basic link (eg. 02A-1-2-12/A27) that leads to the computer in the video.

02A-A-2-8/B32

2.Although it is not shown in the video, each WAO might have a label identifying the
other end of the cable. Why can this be useful? Itâ€™s not often done, probably because of the amount
of labelling required. How else might this task be accomplished?

If the WAO are labelled then if something is not working you can easily find which WAO it is and then check
the corresponding port on the switch. If the WAO is not labbled then you will have to disconnect the ethernet
cable from the WAO and check the switch to see which light are on. Then you could connect the ethernet cable to the
WAO to see which port is corresponds to on the switch.

3.Describe what might happen when a duplex mismatch occurs: one end of a link is
half-duplex, the other full-duplex. Remember that in full-duplex operation,
operation can go in both directions simultaneously.
Would a ping test be likely to demonstrate the presence of a duplex mismatch? Why
or why not. To help you, consider the network traffic that ping generates. If a ping
test would be insufficient describe a test that would detect the presence of a duplex
mismatch.

The full duplex will send regardless of whether is is recieving because it thinks that it can send and recieve
with no problem. The half duplex can only send or recieve not both. This will result is packet loss. A ping test would
not indicate a duplex mismatch because it sends a packet and waits for its response, which it will recieve.
To indicate a mismatch we could send a ping requests and note the average time. We could then send request a
large data file and then another lot of ping requests and note the average time.
If the average ping time increases then there is a duplex mismatch somewhere.
