CPU MEM:client
high singular processing capability, less multiprocessing capability mostly 64 bit now.
standard ram is ample for most consumers (8gb DDR3 1600MHz) possibly even single channel.

ACCESS:cleint
direct access, on a desk or possibly mobile

Licences:Client
if part of a company/organisation they probably will be bulk licenced,
for individual user will most likely come with the machine

Management: CLient
could be on a domain to allow users to log in at different stations without worrying about
transferring data, or if each person is assigned a desk the domain may not be neccesarry.
rarely will clients manage their own machines, we hav SA's for that task.

Security: Server
maximum security, convenience does not exist. SA has full control of the security...
